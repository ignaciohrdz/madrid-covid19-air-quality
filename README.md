# COVID-19 in Madrid

## Introduction

On March 13, after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Spain, the central government in Madrid [declared the state of alarm](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-03-15/spains-state-of-alarm-the-key-measures-that-are-now-in-place.html). Under this state, the movements of citizens will be very limited. This decree will affect the whole of Spain during 15 days although, to be honest, it will probably take longer. Motivated by [previous articles](https://www.businessinsider.com/quarantines-air-pollution-china-but-wont-last-for-long-expert-2020-3?IR=T) on the decreased pollution that has been observed in China, I want to see if our lockdown will have a similar impact in our air quality.

The aim of this project is to analyse air quality parameters day by day since March 12. I am going to extend this project as much as possible, so I can also observe how long it takes us to get Madrid back to our usual pollution levels. My hope is to provide people with enough data to make them think about the impact of our habits in our environment.

## Updates

**Update (1 May 2020)**: As I said before, the lock-down is taking longer than expected. However, we are reaching the end of it. Starting from Saturday, May 2, people will be allowed to go for a one-hour-long walk. It is possible that at this point the pollution levels will begin to rise.

**Update (14 June 2020)**: We are in phase 2, and Madrid is mostly back to normal: everyone is using the car and the public transport works as usual, so probably the air quality will worsen. In June 21st the state of alarm will come to its end.
